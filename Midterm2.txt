The strategy of the program will implement a Comparator interface using a compare() method, which is parameterized with to values of the same data-type. It will return a (-) value if element 1 is < element 2, 
	a (+) value if element 1 is > element 2, and a (0) if both elements are equal. Besides the Comparator interface, In another class the elements would be added to the 
	set. While the Set size is not equal to zero, the set calls the remove() method.
